        I am taking this course because I just love web design and I want to get the knowledge in it. I plan to take some other web-related vourse after this one.
        I also believe it would be useful for me, in the eventuality I might have to work in a career in web develpment.

        I have been a member of the church since I was 6, when my Dad joined the church. I was also opportuned to serve a full-time mission. I must say it was the best decision, and best time of my life, despite the challenges.

        I look forward to knowing all of my classmates and learning from you all.
